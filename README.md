# cutie-hack-2021

## Inspiration
We wanted to connect students together, especially after the social struggles of quarantining and social distancing, so we built a bot that enables users to find mentors and mentees alike that share similar majors and grade levels. 

## What it does
Users are able to "register" their profile in the Little Norman Firebase database, which allows mentors and mentees to find other people's profiles easily, either through searching with the major or year. 

## How we built it
Little Norman built using Python, the Discord.py API and Google's Firebase app development server. 

## Challenges we ran into
Most of our team don't have too much experience with Python, so the vast majority of the time was spent researching and testing Python's specific syntax. We initially struggled to figure out how to implement the functionality that we wanted to build, but eventually solved this issue by splitting up the problem into modules and developing the project one step at a time. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're really proud of our end product of a bot that allows users from all over the place to connect and interact with each other, despite the distance that's been between us because of Covid-19. Although we struggled with a language that's new for most of us, we're happy with how much progress we made over the course of the hackathon. 

## What we learned
We learned how to conduct research using documentation and online sources in order to better understand unfamiliar technologies, and how to use our knowledge to implement a new product. 

## What's next for Tutoring Together, Mentor and Friend Finder!
We're hoping to get the opportunity in the further to expand our bot to have a website, enabling users from all over the world, from different colleges, to form bonds with one another and grow, better together.
